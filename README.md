# Vulnerability
Inside the configuration backup from "Maintenance/System/Configuration Settings" is the bash script "rc.init.sh". The device does not check the integrity of a restored configuration backup which enables editing of set bash script. This bash script will be executed when the device boots. 

# Usage
```
usage: exploit.py [-h] -U USERNAME [-P PASSWORD] -t TARGET -l LHOST -p LPORT

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -U USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Username, ex: admin
  -P PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        Password for the specified user
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        IP of the target, ex: 192.168.99.99
  -l LHOST, --lhost LHOST
                        IP for the reverse shell to connect back to, ex: 123.123.123.123
  -p LPORT, --lport LPORT
                        Port for the reverse shell to connect back to, ex: 8443
```

# Known Bugs
If the device is sleeping, the download of the backup works but the upload creates a connection error. Just execute the exploit twice.
